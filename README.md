# Earthquake Visualization

This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet, D3, and GeoJSON. It retrieves earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed and plots the earthquakes on a map, with markers sized according to magnitude and colored according to depth.

## Getting Started

To view the earthquake visualization, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: The visualization displays an interactive map using Leaflet, allowing users to zoom and pan.
- **Data Visualization**: Earthquakes are represented as markers on the map, with marker size indicating magnitude and marker color indicating depth.
- **Popups**: Clicking on a marker displays a popup with additional information about the earthquake, including magnitude and depth.
- **Legend**: The legend provides context for the map data by indicating depth levels and their corresponding colors.

## Data Source

The earthquake data is sourced from the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/significant_month.geojson).
